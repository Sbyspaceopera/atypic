# Styles

Styles in this folder should be global styles.

## \_normalize.scss

\_normalize.scss is a mixin used to normalize parts of the theme that doesn't need to be manually setup by the WordPress editor. It's beaceause hardcoded styles should be handled through Tailwind in our theme and Tailwind needs a normalization to work properly.

Header, footer, and home are not handled by the user for now.

DO NOT include \_normalize.scss in a class that can conflict with WordPress styles.

## Tailwind

Tailwind handles all non-user-specific styles.

Tailwind styles are marked as `!important` so be carreful about dont running in a conflict with the user styles generated by WordPress when developping.

WordPress static generated css variables (e.g. such as those generated by the `theme.json` file) should be implemented in Tailwind through the `tailwind.config.js` file.

## theme.json

Pleaser refer to https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/themes/theme-json/

## JavaScript styles

For now the JS styles are handled through WordPress/Tailwind.

TODO : web-components should be totally isolated from the context in the future. (e.g.: For now the gallery web-component styles are handled through the gallery block in `src` folder). Basically, it should be props. In the future, it should be CSS container queries.

## Blocks

Blocks related styles should be handled by the WordPress blocks system, excepted for web-components. Blocs are located in the `src` folder.
